# What's ghud?

A simple lifestyle that prioritizes an easygoing rhythm.

## TLDR

There are *four* things *to* keep on the *floor* at all times:

1. Something for you.
2. Something for someone else.
3. Something to track your resources.
4. Something that moves you.

To put it even shorter:

1. Something internal. 
2. Something external.
3. A budget.
4. Art.

Planning too far beyond this and you're tiptoeing a fine line between burnout and self-destruction.
