# "Hello World" Distributed System

So you're an aspiring-, junior-, or mid-level engineer.  
Maybe you're even a senior engineer.  
You know code, you've completed a few projects, you've contributed to large-ish systems.

But you feel like you need to 'level up' architecturally.  
You want experience navigating and working in a highly distributed system.

Congratulations -- you found exactly what you need.  
Take a look around this website and the repos that compose it.  
Read the blog posts about the concepts that inspire it.
Contribute to the project for hands-on experience.
Spend some time with all of this and you'll earn a better idea of what large distributed systems 'feel' like.
