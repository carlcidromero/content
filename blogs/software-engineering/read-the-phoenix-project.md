# Read _The Phoenix Project_

If you're curious why [Agile](https://agilemanifesto.org/) feels yucky at most jobs, _[The Phoenix Project](https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/The-Phoenix-Project/Gene-Kim/The-Phoenix-Project/9781950508945)_ is some great edutainment -- a top contender for my favorite software book of all-time.

## Why I like it

My best friend and software engineering sensei introduced me to this book early in my career. I had a few years of experience with Agile and basically no hands-on experience with dev ops at the time. This book gave me a fuller idea of everything that goes into maintaining software and a good way to use the [Toyota Production System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toyota_Production_System) to do so. Most importantly, it led me to read [_The Goal_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Goal_%28novel%29), which led to [ghud](https://ghud.org).
