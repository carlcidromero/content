# What is he doing with his life?

Sixteen years old.  
Drunk.

His wiser self asks from the mirror,  
"What are you doing with your life?"

He didn't even recognize himself.  
But he adopted the new face staring back at him.

Perhaps he died,  
jumped out of his body  
into the mirror  
and began his reincarnated life  
before collapsing to the floor.
