# They Spoke of Dreams

It wasn't hard to understand what was happening.  
Reality was right under their noses,  
and they finally noticed it.

It was like peering down the bridge of your nose.
Blurry, doubled, and questionably present,  
they hit a shot in the dark about shots in the dark.

_Dreaming_.

They're real, but they're not here.  
They're over there.  
You're watching them unfold.

Sometimes, with focus,  
you can unfold them yourself.

_Phew!_

And just like that,  
the understanding is blown away  
by the _gasp_ of enlightenment.
