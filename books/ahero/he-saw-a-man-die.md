# He Saw a Man Die, For All He Knew

_*Shuffle, shuffle, shuffle...*_

Some low-top canvas sneakers dragged across the wet parking lot. It
had been flooding, so the chaos wasn't off-putting &mdash; it was the
silence.

_*Thud, smack...*_

The thud was a rear-end, the smack was a skull.

Ahero stood on an apartment balcony across the street, a few levels up, _elevated_,
watching.

"I'm gonna have to share this story carefully with my daughter when she grows up."

A tap on the glass.

There she is, in her mother's arms. She's not oblivious. She reads
rooms, people, energy &mdash; even books. Something has happened, but
no one in this space knows exactly what.

"Kids? Drugs?"
"Murder."

It was a statement, a hunch, but not fact. But what does that matter?
Something's off.

"I called 911."

"How come?"

A few minutes had passed, but disassociation is swift.
Red light, blue light...

The kids scrambled.
Vehicles appeared for some.
Others chose to stay.
One had no choice.
